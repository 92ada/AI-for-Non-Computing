    "- c: False. Backgammon is a game of chance, and the opponent may consistently roll much better dice. The perfectly rational backgammon can get optimal result, but is still possible to lose."

For a certain search tree (search tree is the role of recording path and state judgment), backtracking and DFS, the main difference is that backtracking method is not in the solution process. The complete tree structure is preserved, while the depth-first search records the complete search tree.\n",
    "- arc consistency: A directed arc from variable A to variable B in a CSP is arc consistent if, for every value in the current domain of A, there is some consistent value of B.\n",
